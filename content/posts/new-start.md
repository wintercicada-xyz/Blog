Before I start the topic of this article, I would like to explain why I wrote in English first. I think I need to implement my English writing so that I can not only get English articles as input but also write something in English as output. Another reason I wrote in English is that I switched to Arch Linux recently and use Wayland as the display server. There are many issues when it comes to using the input method in Wayland, like the candidate box doesn't show up properly, and cannot use the input method in any electron-based app. I will keep those articles I have written in Chinese, perhaps I will translate them into English in the future. My blog does not have many readers, so I will treat it as my English writing practice book, but to make sure there are not many grammar issues in my article, I will use Grammarly to check it before I post it on the blog.
